 * with `instagram: false` for safety reasons (the Graph API is the most
 * failure-prone integration), but that silently flipped behavior for
 * existing 0.3.x users on upgrade — Instagram posts started piling up
 * in the approval queue with no in-app explanation. The hotfix flips
 * the default back to auto so upgrades are non-breaking; users who
 * want manual gating must opt in via the PipelinePanel checkboxes.
 *
 * `applyV040AutoApproveMigration` (below) writes the explicit
 * auto-everywhere config into a legacy user's saved settings on first
 * post-upgrade load, so their state shows up in the settings UI rather
 * than relying on an undefined-fallback that could shift again later.

 *      A bad caption, mis-tagged image, or model hallucination
 *      goes straight to the audience.
 *   2. Watermark. The watermark pass is performed inside
 *      MashupContext.approveScheduledPost (via
 *      finalizePipelineImagesForPosts). Posts that bypass approval
 *      ALSO bypass the watermark. The fastest way to guarantee
 *      every published image is watermarked is to require every
 *      published post to pass through approval.
 *
 * The `platforms` and `config` parameters are accepted for
 * backwards compatibility with existing call sites; the previous
 * `pipelineAutoApprove` per-platform fast-path is no longer
 * consulted. The setting is kept on `UserSettings` for now (the
 * PipelinePanel UI still renders the checkboxes) so saved user
 * configurations don't get blown away — wiring will be cleaned up
 * in a follow-up. Any platforms array — empty or not — returns
 * `'pending_approval'`.

 * upgrade), persist an explicit auto-everywhere map. This:
 *   1. Locks in the user's pre-upgrade behavior — every platform stays
 *      auto-approved even if the future shifts the runtime default.
 *   2. Makes the user's choices visible in the PipelinePanel checkbox
 *      grid instead of hiding them behind undefined-fallback semantics.
 *
 * Idempotent: returns the input unchanged when `pipelineAutoApprove`
 * is already an object (the user has either explicitly configured it
 * or has already been migrated). Safe to run on every load.
 *
 * Returns the input reference unchanged when no migration is needed,
 * so consumers can use referential equality to skip re-renders.
