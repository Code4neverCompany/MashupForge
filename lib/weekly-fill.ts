// V030-004: weekly fill strategy.
//
// The pipeline's main aim is to fill the entire current N-day window
// (default 7) with scheduled posts before moving on. The daemon already
// had a "target met" check baked into the continuous-mode sleep block,
// but the logic was inline and the per-day target was hardcoded at 2.
// Pulling it out to a pure helper lets:
//   1. the daemon and the UI agree on what "filled" means
//   2. tests exercise the math without spinning up React
//   3. a future change to the target formula (e.g. variable by day of
//      week) lands in one place
//
// Deliberately pure — no Date.now() reads inside; the caller passes
// `now` so tests can pin it.
